We recommend using the `leiningen` tool to install bionitio. You will need to install `leiningen` on your system first.

On OS X this can be can with homebrew like so (you may need to run `brew update` first):

```
$ brew install leiningen
```

Once you have `leiningen` installed you can use it to build bionitio like so:

```
$ lein bin
```

This will create an executable program in the directory called `bin`.

You can run the program like so:

```
$ ./bin/bionitio -h
```
