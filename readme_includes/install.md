We recommend using the `leiningen` tool to install bionitio. Refer to its [installation page](https://leiningen.org/#install)
for more information. packages exist for Ubuntu via `apt`, OSX via `brew`, and a number of others.

Once you have `leiningen` installed you can use it to build bionitio like so:

```
$ lein bin
```

This will create an executable program in the directory called `bin`.

You can run the program like so:

```
$ ./bin/bionitio -h
```
